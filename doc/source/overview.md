# Overview

## Raster Data
This set of APIs provide queries for retrieving statistical and summary data from multidimensional raster datasets containing climate data.

Raster datasets treat data as a regular matrix. Each dataset has a list of latitudes, a list of longitudes, a list of timestamps, and a list of variables such as temperature, precipitation, or derived values like growing degree days. A value may be accessed for every combination of latitude, longitude, timestamp, and variable, which represents the value of that variable at that particular point in time and space. 

These data are interpolated from real-world observations or generated by General Circulation Models or Regional Climate Models, which are able to provide complete data coverage. Individual points may be masked off as missing, but this is typically only done to mark the boundaries of irregular geographic extents, like coastlines. The data should be assumed to be dense within the spatial and temporal boundaries.


## Data Access
This system is not designed to provide individual access to every point in the raster data matrix, but calculates and makes available summary data over user-defined spatial and temporal scales to support analysis and visualization. All numerical API endpoints accept a spatial area of interest (specified in URL-encoded WKT as a point or polygon) and return the mean of all cells within the designated area. If no area is designated, the mean across the entire spatial extent of the dataset is returned. 

Datafiles are organized by temporal range and resolution.

## Modeled Data

Most data accessible by the API is climate data from a General Circulation Model (GCM) or Regional Climate Model (RCM). These numerical models represent physical processes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and land surface of the earth. They simulate the response of the global climate system. The models output meteorological projections like temperature and precipitation. Other available variables represent statistical indices derived from the meteorological outputs.

### Emissions Scenarios

Each dataset has an associated emissions scenario, sometimes called `experiment`. Emissions scenarios represent a range of possible future projections for greenhouse gas concentrations. GCMs and RCMs are typically driven by historical data on greenhouse gas concentrations when modeling the past and present, before using an emissions scenario to provide input on greenhouse gas concentrations to drive future projections.

### Runs

Each dataset has an associated run string, sometimes called `ensemble_member`, which represents the initialization settings of the simulating model. A GCM or RCM may be run multiple times with different initialization conditions.  

## Climatological Means

Most data accessible via this API is normalized as multi-year climatological means. These datasets have been averaged between years over a specified amount of time, typically thirty years. For example, the January value of a precipitation climatological mean dataset for 1961-1990 represents the mean precipitation of January 1961, January 1962, and so on up to January 1990. 

A series of overlapping climatologies are generated from the entire timespan of the model output data.
