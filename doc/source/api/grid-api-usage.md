This endpoint is not currently used by the PCEX frontend. It was originally intended to provide information needed for a user to select a polygon of interest on a map; this functionality is now handled by queries to the ncWMS map server. 

This endpoint may be of use for systems that want to designate spatial areas of especial interest but are not using ncWMS.
