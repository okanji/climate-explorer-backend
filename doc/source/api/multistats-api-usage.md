This endpoint is similar to the `stats` endpoint, but instead of accepting a unique identification string and returning statistics for a timestamp in a single file, it accepts metadata parameters and returns statistics for the selected timestamp from all files that meet those parameters and contain the selected timestamp, organized by the unique ID string. This supports applications that display how statistical measures of a variable change over time or between simulated runs.
